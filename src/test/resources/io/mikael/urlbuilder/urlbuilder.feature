      | https://www:1234             |
      | https://www:1234/            |
      | https://www:1234/foo         |
      | https://www:1234/foo/bar     |
      | https://www:1234/foo/bar/    |
      | https://www:1234/foo/bar//   |
      | https://www:1234/foo//bar//  |
      | //google.com/logo.png        |
      | g:h                          |
      | http://a/b/c/d;p?y           |
      | http://a/b/c/d;p?q#s         |

      | http://a/b/c/g;x?y#s         |
      | http://a/b/c/g#s/../x        |
      | http:g                       |
    Then the urls stay the same after a roundtrip conversion
